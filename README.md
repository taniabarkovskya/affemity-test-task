## 💡 Recommendations

- 1. Adapt layout for big screens
- 2. On summary page make opportunity to change (or to confirm or change) your main choices
- 3. Add simply transitions on hover for buttons and options for better user expirirence
- 4. On pages with multiple choices keep button "All of them" looking active till all of them is not chosen
- 5. *Add option "Never been in relationship" for question "What best describes your previous relationship?" or some additional questions for women that never been in relationship. Or maybe even additional question for single/complicated - "When was the last time you were in a relationship?" 😊

Hope my recommendations are valid and helpful!
